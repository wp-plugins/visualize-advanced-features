Adds an extra button to the Visual Rich Editor (aka wysiwyg, tinymce) to show advanced features.

== Description ==

This very simple little WordPress plugin shows the Advanced Toolbar button in your WordPress 2.1x WYSIWYG Post Editor. No more fumbling around for the correct hotkey to show these “hidden” buttons. Just click the button (see red circled image below).

Visualize Toolbar

If you use the wysiwyg editor, you’ll want to give this a try. I think you’ll be pleased.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `ST_Visualize.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I tell if it is working? =

You'll see a new button at the right end of your Post Editor toolbar

= I don't see the new button =

1. Have you verified that you activated the plugin?
1. Are you using the Visual Rich Editor?
1.1 Check Users -> Your Profile, the top checkbox should be checked.
1.  You may need to clear your browser's local cache (ctrl-F5 in Firefox, for example)


== Screenshots ==

1. See the pretty new button on the right?  (circled in Red for our non-color blind friends)

== Thank You ==

Big shout to Mark Steel for the code.
