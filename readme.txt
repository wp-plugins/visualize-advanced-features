Adds an extra button to the Visual Rich Editor (aka wysiwyg, tinymce) to show advanced features.

== Description ==

This very simple little WordPress plugin shows the Advanced Toolbar button in your WordPress 2.1x 
WYSIWYG Post Editor. No more fumbling around for the correct hotkey to show these "hidden" buttons. 
Just click the button (see red circled image in the screenshot).

If you use the wysiwyg editor, you'll want to give this a try. I think you'll be pleased.
